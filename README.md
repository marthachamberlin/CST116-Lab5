functions+


Write a program that asks for an employee’s salary and years of service.
Use the following functions to manipulate the information as described.
Please use the included function signatures:
* void GetInput(float& salary, int& years_service);
   * This function prompts for and reads the required salary and years of service.
* void CalcRaise(float& salary, int years_service);
   * This function changes the salary dependent upon the years of service. If the employee has greater than 10 years of service, they will receive a 10% raise. Between 5 and 10 years, they will receive a 5% raise. Everybody else will receive a 2% raise.
* int CalcBonus(int years_service);
   * This function calculates and returns the employee’s bonus for the year. They will receive $500 for every 2 years of service.
* void PrintCalculations(int years_service, float salary, int bonus);
   * This function will display in a clear and professional manner all of the calculated information.

Default arguments


Write a program that uses a function to read three values representing hours, minutes and seconds.
Pass these three values to another function that will display the time in an appropriate style.
A fourth, optional, argument to the display function specifies whether to display the time in 24 hour notation, Military time, or Standard format: you may select the default for this.
Both of these functions are to be called from main().
When testing, be sure that you call the display function using both three and four arguments.
